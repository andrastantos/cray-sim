On COS side there's the Any Packet Table (APT) that describes MIOP<-->COS communication. APT types:

C1		Cray mainframe identifier
EX		EXEC identifier
A		Disk IO
B		Front-end IO
C		Error message
D		Tape IO
E		Echo
G		Tape confguration
I		Initialization, part 1
J		Initialization, part 2
K		Kernel request
N		Null request
S		Statistics request

A packets are described in SM-0045-E_COS_Table_Descriptions_Reference_Manual.pdf, page 46

A-packets are handled by CDEM on the MIOP side. The packet gets scheduled in ICRI in the kernel (K)

The MIOP queues an MC$MSTIO which means 'mass storage i/o' in the DAL, which will start (or rather queue) the proper
operation on the DIOP (in ACOM)

I think the completion message sent back to the mainframe is a MC$CSTAT message. ACOM seems to process this response and
send the reply back to the mainframe, but it seems if I understand correctly, it's a reply with the same 'A' packet type
just SRC and DST swapped

Packet type is in the second byte of DID. Task ID is a bit confusing.

At any rate, it should be possible to parse these packets on the low-speed channel and fire events based on their content
