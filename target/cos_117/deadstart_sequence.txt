B.1.2 DEADSTART

The following procedure describes how to deadstart the lOS from either
tape or disk. The deadstart tape and disk contain the following files:

    Tape     Disk        Description
	------   ---------   -------------------------------
    FILE 0   TAPELOAD    Tape deadstart program
    FILE 1   DISKLOAD    Disk deadstart program
    FILE 2   DMP I/O     Processor dump program
    FILE 3   KERNEL      The IOS Kernel
    FILE 4   KERNEL.OV   IOS overlays
    FILE 5   COS         COS
    FILE 6   PARAM       Parameter file
    FILE 7   CLEARIO     Clear IDS program
    FILE 8   DSDIAG      IOS deadstart diagnostic control program
    FILE 9   DSDIAG.OV   IOS deadstart diagnostic overlays

Step   Procedure
----   ------------------------------------------------------------
1a.    Mount the deadstart tape on the Peripheral Expander tape unit.
                             or
lb.    Mount the deadstart disk in the Peripheral Expander drive unit.
2.     Set lOS maintenance panel toggle switches as follows:

                                                  Switch Setting
                  Loading From                   Octal     Binary
				  ---------------------------    -------   --------
                  Tape                           22        010 010
                  AMPEX disk unit                60        110 000
                  CDC disk unit                  27        010 111

3.     Depress IOP-O MC (or MASTER CLEAR on CRAY-1/A) and DEADSTART
       buttons on the Power Distribution Unit or lOS chassis maintenance
       panel (depending on your site).

4.     Respond to the prompt at the MIOP Kernel console as follows. (If
       the FILE @MTO prompt is not displayed, verify that a tape is
       mounted on the Peripheral Expander tape unit.)

       Prompt       Response
	   -----------  ------------------------------------------
       FILE @MTO:   Enter 3 and press RETURN (loads Kernel and
                    performs initialization)

       FILE @DKO:   Enter either the directory name (dir/) to
                    display a menu of all files in requested
                    directory or enter the
                    Kernel filename (dir/Kernel) to load the
                    Kernel and perform initialization.

                    Press RETURN.

         ============================================================
     					            NOTE
           When starting from disk, the Kernel expects the Kernel
           overlays to have the same Kernel name and appended with
           a ".OV" (for example; a Kernel with file name lOS must
           have the overlays with filename IOS.OV).
         ============================================================
    
       The Kernel goes through its initialization sequence and displays
       the following message on the Kernel console of all lOPs:
       
           IOP-n KERNEL, VERSION x.xx SNsn, site. mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss
       
       	n           Number designating the lOP where the console is
                       attached
       	x.xx        Software version number
       	sn          Mainframe serial number
       	site        Installation location
       	mm/dd/yy    Kernel assembly date
       	hh:mm:ss    Kernel assembly time
       
       The following message can appear on the BIOP or DIOP console only:
       
           DISK NOT READY CH nn
       
       The message indicates that the configured system disk has not
       responded to attempts to select it. The disk might be disabled at
       the lOS Power Distribution Unit cabinet, at the lOS deadstart
       panel, or at the disk unit itself (maintenance mode). This
       message may not indicate a problem since the operating system
       being loaded in the mainframe controls which configured devices
       must be present for successful operation.

5.     If your IOS does not have a Peripheral Expander clock, two prompts
       are issued at the MIOP Kernel console for the current date" and
       time.

         ============================================================
     					            NOTE
           If your lOS is equipped with a Peripheral Expander
           clock, you are not asked to enter date and time. See
           SETIME command (section 2) to set or reset the
           Peripheral Expander clock.
     
     	  Proceed to step 6.
         ============================================================

	  After the "ENTER DATE:" prompt, enter the date in the following
      format:

	      mm/dd/yy

	  Once the date has been accepted, the MIOP Kernel console displays
      the "ENTER TIME:" prompt. Enter the time in the following format:
	  
	      hh:mm:ss

6.    Proceed to the Cray Mainframe Deadstart procedure (subsection B.2).
