This repository contains the source code for the Cray PVP simulator. This simulator allows you
to run unmodified Cray software for the following machines:
- Cray XMP
- Cray YMP-el
- Cray J90
- Cray SV1
Support for other machines, such as the Cray-1, the Cray-YMP, even the Cray-C90 and Cray-T90
would most likely be possible, but for the lack of SW availablility for these platforms.

Apart from the source code, also included in the repository the tools and files needed to
create an executable COS-1.17 image for the Cray-XMP.

If you have access to old Cray SW, especially for as-of yet unsupported machines,
please contact me!
